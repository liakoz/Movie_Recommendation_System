# Movie_Recommendation_System
A simple movie recommendation system in Python using both Content-based and Collaborative Filtering.

Content-based approach :
1)Download MovieLens Dataset
2)Ask user to rate 18 different genres so we can know his/her preferences.
3)Compute Movie Scores based on those preferences and finally
4)Print top 5 as recommendations

Collaborative Filtering approach:
Given a set of user's preferred movies we compute a correlation matrix based on Pearson's coef
and print the top 15(as far as the similarity score is concerned) movies.
